This directory contains files for deploying srcclr as a
linux service.  It allows you to run a srcclr agent
continueously in the background.  When a callback from
github (or other SCM tool) via a webhook, the SourceClear
platform will automatically kick off a scan.

Details on setting up srcclr to run as service are
found on https://srcclr.help
