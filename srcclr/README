If you have not already installed the SourceClear command line (CLI) 
interface please do so by running the install.sh script in
this directory.

The srcclr CLI is configured on the website at https://srcclr.com.
After installation the second step is to create a new agent and 
run "srcclr activate" to create a config file.

Alternativly, you can copy or create a config file in 
$HOME/.srcclr/agent.yaml.  Be sure to include a JWT token to 
authenticate the agent with the platform.
